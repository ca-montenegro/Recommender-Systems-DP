# Recommender Systems. Deep learning projects
## Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands

This repository contains various projects/applications of some Deep learning emphasis areas (e.g. NLP, Image Analysis & Generation,...). The projects were developed for the course Recommender Systems at the Eindhoven University of Technology taught by Dr. Vlado Menkovski. This was focused on developing models for high dimensional data such as natural text, images, and audio. Furthermore, the course center in the study of how to use these models and representations in classification, retrieval, and recommendations.
